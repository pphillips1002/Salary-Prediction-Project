Software Engineer,$69K-$78K (Glassdoor est.),"About Us


Looking to use your engineering skills to help make the world a better place? We’re building products to improve the lives of people in emerging markets by making it easier to send them money. Our web portal and API helps: non-profits provide assistance to people living in poverty, agricultural firms pay farmers for their crops, and gig economy startups pay workers—and there are many more opportunities for impact.

In the countries we work in, many people don't have easy access to a bank account, so digital mobile money services like M-Pesa have become a vital part of the financial system. Different countries and providers do this differently and incompatibly. This makes it difficult to get money to people in those countries. The Segovia payments platform abstracts this away, providing a simple way to send money to mobile money networks in 11 countries and counting across Africa.

We are a small team looking to hire people who are excited by our mission and share our values. We offer competitive salary and equity compensation, flexible hours, and great medical, dental, and vision benefits.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Your Role


As a Software Engineer at Segovia, you’ll help define, build, iterate and test our core products. More specifically you will:
Build new features to expand the capabilities of the Segovia Payment Gateway API and web portal.
Research and invent creative solutions to meet the challenges of delivering technology in developing countries.
Support our deployment team by delivering new functionality and implementing program requirements for our customers.
Work with partners around the world to add new countries and payment methods to our payment network.
Collaborate with our operations team to build internal tools and help automate the business.
Identify and help fix performance bottlenecks across the whole stack.
Our backend services are written in a mix of languages including Java, Kotlin and Python; we use PostgreSQL as our main datastore and AWS for our infrastructure, which we manage using Terraform and Ansible. Our front end is written in JavaScript, and we use React.

Requirements:
You are a strong developer with at least 2 years of experience writing clean, production-quality code.
You have a firm grasp of relational databases.
You collaborate well with others to make engineering and product decisions.
Ideally you are also:


Motivated by our mission and want to build technology that makes a difference
Excited to work on a small team across all parts of the stack.
Experienced with building and supporting cloud-based web infrastructure with Linux and AWS.
A good communicator and natural collaborator who can work with colleagues at all levels.
Able to spot bad user experiences and suggest improvements.
Note that while some of our team is based out of New York City—we have an office in SoHo—we also have engineers in SF and Boston and other team members in the UK, Rwanda, and Uganda. That means we operate as a remote team and we’re open to candidates in the Americas, Africa, Europe.",2.4,"Segovia

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

Some of the problems you will solve entail understanding data, identifying patterns, quantifying the impact of ML / NLP models and designing data visualizations. We seek a data scientist to help drive a new digital AI product team on a mission to unlock the potential of data and identify new opportunities.

As one of the founding members of a small, multi-disciplinary team of technologists, designers and product managers, you’ll have the freedom to make key product decisions without much oversight, and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly. You’ll be a part of a startup-like environment, with the opportunity to have more control and leadership; in a company with thousands of existing customers.

You sail smooth in Python and always have sklearn, tensorflow, keras and pytorch on deck.
K-means more than a curt text and Logit and Probit are not Hobbit characters.
You have experience with relational databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle or SQL Server, and maybe even Hadoop, Hive, Spark or Redshift.
You strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where BERT/ELMo are not just Sesame Street© characters.
What you’ll own
The foundation for advanced analytics at a global company.
The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.
Minimum Qualifications
Degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics, statistics, data science or a related technical field, or equivalent practical experience.
3 years of work experience in data science or related field.
Experience with statistical modeling using R, Python, or similar statistical languages.
In depth knowledge of advanced models such as generalized linear models, penalized regression models, tree based models and neural networks
Proven track record building business-practical models and implementing them into production.

We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender non-conforming, first and second-generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

Responsibilities


The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information.

The need to maintain our core Computer Science group is vital to provide the technical capabilities necessary to successfully execute NSA's mission. The increased complexity of supporting NSA's mission requires world class researchers, programmers, and developers who operate in teams in areas such as software engineering, reverse engineering, information technology infrastructure, high performance computing, data science, architectures, computer security, and networking in order to design and develop advanced tools, techniques, and systems.

Description of Position

Research Scientists design, develop, deliver, and/or operate solutions to hard computer science problems within a scientific framework. The solutions may arise in the forms of forensics and attack attribution, protection of critical networks, active systems warnings and indicators, active penetration into target systems, knowledge discovery of passive and active systems, or other computer science mission support.

The Research Directorate is one of the NSA's six major directorates. Our mission is to conduct and operationalize research to help NSA improve the way it conducts its signals intelligence and cybersecurity missions (see www.nsa.gov/what-we-do for more information on these missions). Successful NSA researchers generalize a mission problem, conduct research to solve the problem, and work with other NSA organizations to apply the research to mission problems. Many NSA research activities have directly contributed to saving lives and protecting computer networks. In addition to working closely with our mission partners, our researchers collaborate regularly with the scientific community in academia, industry, and other government laboratories. We regularly publish papers on the unclassified aspects of our work in scientific conferences and journals. Many of the unclassified systems we have built have been released to the open source software development community (e.g., SELinux, SEAndroid, Accumulo). Our researchers also interact with the community at large by serving as adjunct faculty members at local universities, and participating in K-12 STEM outreach activities across the country. Unlike many federal research labs, the NSA Research Directorate is funded internally, which allows our researchers to spend their time conducting research rather than writing proposals.

The Research Directorate of the National Security Agency is interested in applicants conducting research in systems (operating systems, compilers, databases, distributed computing, networking), machine learning, data science, human-machine teaming, cybersecurity, computer vision, and computational linguistics. Successful candidates for Research Scientist positions should have demonstrated success in conducting Computer Science research, and depending on the area, demonstrated the ability to turn research ideas into running prototype-grade systems.

You get easily excited about Continuous Delivery. You know your testing tools and are comfortable with platforms like Docker, CircleCI, and Artifactory.
You have a keen understanding of Microservices and how they are modeled; you are not intimidated by concepts like Messaging Buses (eg Kafka, NATS), Pub-Sub, and Clustering.
You know the modern technical stack from the network up and are incredibly grateful that you can programmatically control all of it thanks to AWS or Azure or Google.
You have a deep respect for the challenges associated with operating a large-scale system in product, and your designs and implementations reflect that understanding.

ABOUT THE GIG
Work directly with our Engineering Teams to design, implement, and deploy critical software systems that will turn business travel from mundane to magical. The critical path to success is to write code that can access multiple APIs in parallel with extremely low latency and store them in a massive data cluster. And do that a few billion times a day.
Work in cross-functional teams with Product, UX, Quality Engineering, and business experts to participate in feature design and create the next generation of business travel.
This is a contract role
ABOUT OUR TECH STACK
We’re beyond passionate about using cutting-edge technologies. We've implemented a microservices cloud (AWS) based tech stack that allows for rapid iteration and scaling. We use React and Material UI on the frontend, mostly Node.js with Typescript on the backend, Go for anything performance heavy, MySQL as our main datastore and NoSQL products for certain domain-specific datastores.

While we have preferences as an organization for certain technologies, our microservices-based architecture allows us to experiment with new tech and always pick the right tools for the job if it is called for. Our devops setup allows us to quickly stand up / burn down services, frontends and datastores as business needs change. In short the theme of our tech stack is flexibility. We can quickly stand up things, change them, and scale them up or down as our requirements change.

ABOUT US
We are positive, passionate, playful, and always pushing to be better. Our team is a hodgepodge of challenge seekers, travel gurus, startup junkies, and data-miners who see the big picture.

YOU WANT TO TALK TO US IF…
You are motivated by disrupting the norm.
You have a great sense of humor and take your profession seriously, but not yourself.
Your entrepreneurial spirit drives your bias for action.
You are all about constructive feedback - you can dish it out and you can take it.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

You're self-motivated and take initiative to solve problems and fixing things
You're comfortable giving and receiving feedback as part of a collaborative team and development process
You have a positive attitude and a growth mindset
You have 1-3 years of professional software development experience and, ideally, a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
The two most important personal attributes for this role are attitude and aptitude a willingness to learn and desire to push yourself. And from a technology perspective, the most important things are working with complexity, and legacy systems. Are those things you're interested in? Are you looking to be part of a genuinely collaborative team? And to do meaningful work? If so, we'd love to hear from you so apply today and we'll take it from there!

We embrace diversity and equal opportunity, and are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills.

About RMS

There’s a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we’re on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

RMS helped pioneer the natural catastrophe model market we now lead – and we continue to innovate. In May 2019, we announced RMS Risk Intelligence™ (RI), an open-standard platform for strategic risk management. Through this purpose-built platform, clients can tap into RMS HD models, rich data layers, intuitive applications and APIs that simply integrate into existing enterprise systems to support business decisions across underwriting, risk selection, mitigation, and portfolio management.

How we understand and manage risk affects everyone and our passion is nothing less than creating a more resilient world through a better understanding of catastrophic events.

What began as a humble exchange for teachers looking to share lesson plans has since exploded into a massive marketplace where teachers have created more than 4 million resources for all aspects of PreK-12 education. More than six million educators worldwide (including teachers, administrators, and parents) have downloaded TpT resources more than a billion times.
